Focus Timer - A productivity helper

A simple application written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'ts a Focus Timer, based on Pomodore Method where you set the time with 5 minutes intervals, starting a countdown with an alarm sound at the finish of a cicle. During the countdown or with the timer stopped, you can activate some cards that handle four ambience sounds and control their volumes with a slider.
In this application, I used basics of JavaScript, like DOM and ES Modules with Factorys.
